KASTREDUX: KAST optical spectral reduction package
**************************************************

KASTREDUX is a python-based spectral reduction package for the
Lick/KAST spectrograph.


Installation and Dependencies
=============================

KASTREDUX can be cloned from the github site
https://github.com/aburgasser/kastredux. which is updated on a regular
basis. More detailed instructions are on the installation page.

KASTREDUX has the following external dependencies:
   * astropy

   * matplotlib

   * numpy

   * pandas

   * scipy

To make sure the code can access associated data files, you need to
set the code path, which can be done in the following wayss:

   * include the path to the kastredux top-level folder in your
     system "PATH" environmental variable

   * include the path to the kastredux top-level folder in your
     "PYTHONPATH" environmental variable

   * set a new environmental variable called "KASTREDUX_PATH" to the
     kastredux top-level folder

KASTREDUX has been tested on python 3.6.x.

KASTREDUX has not yet reached v1.0, so bugs are likely. Please help us
squish them by sending bug reports to aburgasser@ucsd.edu or start an
issue on the github site
https://github.com/aburgasser/kastredux/issues.
